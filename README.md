# Radarline
This is a program that overlays a radarline and a dot over a Call of Duty instance in order to make wallbanging and sniping easier.

## Troubleshooting
- **Why doesn't the overlay show in game?**
  - To avoid injections, fullscreen is not possible. You must run the game in borderless or windowed. 
- **Why doesn't the overlay change colors when the radarline is lined up?**
  - Make sure dynamic mode and/or color blind assist is on.
- **How do I move the radarline/dot?**
  - Check the respective box, and with the GUI in focus, use WASD to move the element.
